                    Welcome to Willowdale Online School!
                    Willowdale High School is a private secondary school located in North York that offers courses for students grades 9-12.
                    Our teachers provide student-centered approaches to teaching to challenge students and hone their critical thinking skills to think for themselves so they are prepared to become productive and independent individuals in society.
                    The difference between Willowdale High School and typical public high schools is we aim for academic excellence and focus on the students, giving them feedback tailored to their needs, rather than a one size fits all approach.
                    We pride ourselves in helping students create everlasting learning experiences and integrating them into this diverse multicultural country we call our home.
